# Redmi Pad (yunluo) — LineageOS 24.0 build fixes

Reusable notes and opt-in helpers for the **unofficial Android 17 / LineageOS 24.0** bring-up on Xiaomi Redmi Pad (yunluo).

**Status:** work in progress, not a boot-tested ROM or a guarantee that the build will finish.

## Source of truth

The actual fixes have already been committed to these repositories on branch main:

- [Device tree](https://github.com/hashyofficial/android_device_xiaomi_yunluo)
- [Vendor blobs](https://github.com/hashyofficial/android_vendor_xiaomi_yunluo)
- [MediaTek hardware](https://github.com/hashyofficial/android_hardware_mediatek)
- [Manifest](https://github.com/hashyofficial/local_manifests)

This repository is a **reproducible backup/checklist** of the fixes, not a separate replacement for those upstream trees.

## Fixes recorded

1. Remove missing hardware/lineage/compat Soong namespace from vendor Android.bp.
2. Expose hardware/google/pixel/usb and hardware/google/pixel/pixelstats to MediaTek Soong.
3. Rename MediaTek proprietary libformatter module to libformatter_mtk (preserve installed filename with stem: "libformatter"); update codec2 dependencies and vendor package list.
4. Remove absent vendor/lineage/config/device_framework_matrix.xml from the device framework matrix list.
5. Declare lineage_health.charging_control_supports_bypass using soong_config_set_bool, not a string setter.
6. Export hardware/google/pixel/power-libperfmgr through PRODUCT_SOONG_NAMESPACES so the existing Pixel power HAL resolves.
7. Avoid the vendor/lib64/libmnl.so duplicate install rule by removing its VENDOR_PLATFORM_LINKS symlink entry in device/xiaomi/yunluo/Android.mk. Keep the actual Soong-installed module.
8. Use a local manifest pointing to hashyofficial sources on main and LineageOS hardware/xiaomi on lineage-24.0.

See [fix history](docs/fix-history.md) for failures, locations, and scope.

## Use on a future fresh checkout

For a source directory such as ~/android/lineage, first sync the [personal manifest](https://github.com/hashyofficial/local_manifests/blob/main/mt6789.xml). The upstream personal repositories should **already** include the fixes above.

From a second directory, clone this helper repository, then inspect what (if anything) needs patching:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/hashyofficial/lineage_source_build_fix.git ~/lineage_source_build_fix
python3 ~/lineage_source_build_fix/scripts/apply-known-fixes.py --root ~/android/lineage
~~~

To apply only if the dry-run explicitly reports expected older source patterns:

~~~bash
python3 ~/lineage_source_build_fix/scripts/apply-known-fixes.py --root ~/android/lineage --apply
~~~

The helper validates all targeted files before changing any; it refuses unexpected layouts and backs up modified files under out/lineage-source-fix-backups/. It does **not** edit build/soong or run repo sync, make clean, or the build itself.

## Host memory

See [memory and swap](docs/memory-and-swap.md). Our wattOS R13 test system has 16 GiB-class physical RAM, 8 GiB ZRAM (zstd, priority 100), and two 32 GiB NVMe swapfiles (priorities -2 and -3). This has shown severe memory stalls in Soong. Trying 16 GiB ZRAM is a **test**, not a confirmed fix. Never run swapoff -a while building or under high swap usage.

## Experimental or unproven changes

- Local build/soong/cmd/soong_build/main.go tweak: runtime/debug.SetGCPercent(40) and SetMemoryLimit(12 << 30). **Not a validated optimization; not applied by this helper**. It may increase garbage-collection overhead and slow a memory-heavy build. Prefer stock Soong for reliable A/B testing.
- external/libjxl/Android.bp vendor_available removal was an older workaround for an Android.bp vendor-variant error. **Not automatically applied** because it changes an external project and may have side effects.
- Compilation passed Soong Android.bp analysis and then exposed Make/module errors. Passing bootstrap does not imply the ROM boots.

## Safety

Never apply this helper to a different device, release branch, or changed source layout without reviewing diffs. Do not flash an untested build solely because compilation succeeds.
